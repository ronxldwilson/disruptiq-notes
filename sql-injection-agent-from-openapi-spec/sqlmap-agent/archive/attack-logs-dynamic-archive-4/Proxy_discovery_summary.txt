[15:14:15] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Rerun without providing the option '--technique'. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment') and/or switch '--random-agent'
