it is recommended to perform only basic UNION tests if there is not at least one other (potential) technique found. Do you want to reduce the number of requests? [Y/n] Y

[15:11:49] [WARNING] GET parameter 'name' does not seem to be injectable
[15:11:49] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Rerun without providing the option '--technique'. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment') and/or switch '--random-agent'
