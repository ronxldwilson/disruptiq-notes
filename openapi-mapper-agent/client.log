2025-10-22 14:39:12,267 - INFO - Prompt: Given the following API endpoints and their corresponding code, generate a complete OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification in YAML format. **Important: The specification must be based *only* on the information provided in the code. Do not invent any new information, endpoints, or schemas.**

The specification should include:
- `openapi: 3.0.0`
- `info`: Generate a descriptive title, version, and description for the API based on the provided endpoints.
- `paths`: For each unique path, create a single path item and combine all HTTP methods under that path. Provide summaries, descriptions, parameters, and schemas.
- `components`: Infer data schemas for request/response bodies from the code. Use descriptive names and include examples.

Output only the YAML specification, nothing else. Do not include any explanatory text, headers, or code blocks.

Here are the endpoints:
- Path: /
  Methods: ['GET']
  Code:
```
/// <reference types="next" />
/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />
/// <reference path="./.next/types/routes.d.ts" />

// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/typescript for more information.

```

Generate the OpenAPI spec for these endpoints.
